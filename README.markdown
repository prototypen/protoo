# What is protoo

A new Personal Publishing Platform that gives the user the most options to publish common types of media without being in the way - needing no backend to add end edit content. It has maximum amount of flexibility in the creation, combination and display of content. To achieve these goals it uses state of the art [html5](http://www.html5rocks.com) and [css3](http://www.w3schools.com/css3) technology and [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) asynchronous programming with the shemeless database [mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org).


## Modules

To allow for a maximum flexibility protoo uses a module system - so called protons - to add unlimited amount of functionality. The Module API is very easy to understand (function and views).


## Rip Mix Remix

Protoo is also exposing all data so that different instances of protoo (and other apps) can easily reuse the content. All shared content has metadata embedded that also includes the original author and the license used to publish the content.


## Tagging

Protoo relies solely on tagging to organize the content which gives unlimited power to organize and display it in different ways.
